## Description
This application uses a CLI to generate a team.html file that displayes a list of employees created from user input in an easy-to-read format. The CLI ask's the user question using the inquirer package to create the employee information. Some of the questions use a validation method when needed if the answers require a specific type of input.

## Installation
Once you have a copy of the files in this repository, you will need to make sure you have the "inquirer" and "email-validator" packages installed. Use the "npm install" command in the terminal to install them from the package.json file.

## Usage
Once you have completed the installation steps above, you can then use the inquirer package to generate employee team members that will be added to a team.html file. To run the application, make sure you are inside the correct terminal directory and simply type "node app" in the terminal. You should then be prompted with a list of questions that will determin the contents of your html file. When you have finished creating all the employees you wanted, enter "no" when asked if you want to create another employee. The application will end and return a new team.html file in the output directory.
